# Replanter
Replanter is a simple client side mod that allows players to quickly replant their fully grown crops.  
Simply right click on a fully grown crop while holding seeds and it'll be harvested and replanted instantly.  
A list of supported crops below:  
- Wheat
- Carrots
- Potatos
- Beetroot
- Nether Wart
- Cocoa Beans (Must hold iron axe or above in mainhand and cocoa beans in offhand)

Crops will be fortuned as long as the player is holding the tool in their mainhand and seeds in their offhand.  

If you'd like me to add other crops, please suggest them in the comments or create an issue on [github](https://github.com/kregerl/Replanter)
